# Datasets
PM2.5 Air Quality Forecasting. This dataset is the related air data which is obtained from UCI and collected near the US Embassy in China during 2010 to 2014. The preprocessing of data is similar with the previous experiment. The data from the first 1.5 years serve as the training set and the rest as a testing set (or validation set).
